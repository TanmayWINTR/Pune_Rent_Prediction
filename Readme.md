-Built a model using linear regression and sklearn, and a dataset of Pune house rentals. 
-The model predicts the rent of a given location in pune with an accuracy of 87%.
-Tools used for the model are :
1.Python
2.pandas and numpy for data cleaning
3.sklearn for model building
4.vs code and google colab as IDE 
-Wrote a python flask server  that uses this rent prediction model to serve the http requests.
-Built a website using html,css and JavaScript that allows the users to enter sq ft area and other parameters which calls the flask server to retrieve the predicted rent price.
